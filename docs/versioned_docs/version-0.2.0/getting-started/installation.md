## Installing `zotero-mdnotes`

You can install the plugin in Zotero as described [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins):

> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your computer. Then, in Zotero, click “Tools → Add-Ons”, then drag the `.xpi` for the plugin onto the Add-Ons window that opens

You can grab the latest version of `mdnotes` [here](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes/releases/latest).

:::tip
If you're using Firefox, make sure to right-click on the `xpi` file and use the `Save as` menu, otherwise Firefox will try to install the xpi as a plugin and will throw an error.
